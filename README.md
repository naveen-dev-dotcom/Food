🍲 Lucky Draw Food App – Regatta 2025

This is a React.js web app (powered by Vite) built for my college function "Regatta" (12th Sept 2025).
The app was used live in the event to conduct a Lucky Draw game where students across all years participated.

🎯 How it works:

The app contains 10 food items with a total of 132 counts.

Each class selected one boy and one girl as lucky participants.

The app shuffles the food items and randomly assigns them to the winners.

Used in front of students & management during the function.
